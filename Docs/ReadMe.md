# Developing This Demo

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a basic characteristic of many modern CLI tools: the ability to detect if the currently installed version is up-to-date.

I used ChatGPT (Jan 9 version) to help me with the code. It was remarkably helpful!

I had never done this kind of code before, and I started by Googling for some answers. I didn't get anything helpful from Google, partly because of the search engine's inability to understand the context of my search queries and also because the "mapping" to page results had a lot of overlap with unrelated items based on words such as "GitHub", "Package Registry", "version", "check", etc.

ChatGPT, however, got my intent immediately, and I was able to get up-and-running extremely fast! Here's a transcript of the interaction.

> ðŸ˜ƒ Do you know about the GitHub Package Registry?
>
> ðŸ¤– Yes, I am familiar with GitHub Package Registry. It is a package management service that allows you to host and manage your packages, such as libraries and binaries, directly on GitHub. It integrates with GitHub, so you can use the same workflow and tools you use for your code. Developers can easily discover, use, and share packages with their team and the wider community. It supports a variety of package types, including npm, Maven, and NuGet, and it works seamlessly with GitHub Actions and other CI/CD tools.

>
> ðŸ˜ƒ Imagine that I have a C# application that wants to check its current version against the versions available in the GitHub Package Registry. What code would I need to write to accomplish this?
>
> ðŸ¤– In order to check the current version of your C# application against the versions available in the GitHub Package Registry, you will need to make use of the NuGet package manager.
>
> ðŸ¤– First, you will need to add the NuGet package `System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation` to your application. This package provides information about the system and the runtime environment.
>
> ðŸ¤– Then, you can use the following code snippet to check the current version of your application and compare it to the latest version available in the GitHub Package Registry:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Reflection;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

string currentVersion = Assembly.GetEntryAssembly()
    .GetCustomAttribute<AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute>()
    .InformationalVersion;

// Use the NuGet package manager to check for updates
var updateChecker = new UpdateChecker();
var updateAvailable = updateChecker.CheckForUpdates("myusername", "myrepository", currentVersion);

if (updateAvailable)
{
    Console.WriteLine("A new version is available. Please update your application.");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Your application is up to date.");
}
```
>
> ðŸ¤– This code will check the current version of the application against the latest version available in the GitHub Package Registry. The `CheckForUpdates` method should take as input the GitHub user name, repository name and current version of the application.
>
> ðŸ¤– This code is just a sample, you will need to write the logic to check against the package registry, it could be a web service or direct API call to the GitHub Package Registry API.
>
> ðŸ¤– Please note that the `UpdateChecker` class needs to be implemented to make the API call and parse the response from GitHub Package Registry.
>
> ---
>
> ðŸ˜ƒ How would I write a unit test for this using xUnit?
You can write a unit test for the code that checks the current version of your application against the versions available in the GitHub Package Registry using xUnit.
>
> ðŸ¤– Here is an example of how you might write a unit test for the `CheckForUpdates` method using xUnit:
>
```csharp
using Xunit;

public class UpdateCheckerTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void CheckForUpdates_ReturnsTrue_WhenNewerVersionIsAvailable()
    {
        // Arrange
        var updateChecker = new UpdateChecker();
        string currentVersion = "1.0.0";

        // Act
        bool updateAvailable = updateChecker.CheckForUpdates("myusername", "myrepository", currentVersion);

        // Assert
        Assert.True(updateAvailable);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void CheckForUpdates_ReturnsFalse_WhenNoNewerVersionIsAvailable()
    {
        // Arrange
        var updateChecker = new UpdateChecker();
        string currentVersion = "2.0.0";

        // Act
        bool updateAvailable = updateChecker.CheckForUpdates("myusername", "myrepository", currentVersion);

        // Assert
        Assert.False(updateAvailable);
    }
}
```
>
> ðŸ¤– In this example, the `CheckForUpdates_ReturnsTrue_WhenNewerVersionIsAvailable` test case is checking that the `CheckForUpdates` method returns `true` when a newer version is available in the GitHub Package Registry. The `CheckForUpdates_ReturnsFalse_WhenNoNewerVersionIsAvailable` test case is checking that the method returns `false` when no newer version is available.
>
> ðŸ¤– To make the test cases pass you will need to mock the API call and return the expected response. You can use a tool like Moq to create a mock implementation of the `UpdateChecker` class that returns the expected results for the API call.
>
> ðŸ¤– You will also need to update the test cases with the expected version and the expected return value of the `CheckForUpdates` method.
>
> ðŸ¤– It's important to keep in mind that, this is just an example, you will need to adapt the test cases to your specific needs.
>
> ---
>
> ðŸ˜ƒ Show me the code to do the mocking with Moq.
>
> ðŸ¤– Here is an example of how you might use Moq to create a mock implementation of the `UpdateChecker` class for testing the `CheckForUpdates` method:

```csharp
using Moq;
using Xunit;

public class UpdateCheckerTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void CheckForUpdates_ReturnsTrue_WhenNewerVersionIsAvailable()
    {
        // Arrange
        string currentVersion = "1.0.0";
        var mockUpdateChecker = new Mock<IUpdateChecker>();
        mockUpdateChecker
            .Setup(x => x.CheckForUpdates("myusername", "myrepository", currentVersion))
            .Returns(true);

        // Act
        bool updateAvailable = mockUpdateChecker.Object.CheckForUpdates("myusername", "myrepository", currentVersion);

        // Assert
        Assert.True(updateAvailable);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void CheckForUpdates_ReturnsFalse_WhenNoNewerVersionIsAvailable()
    {
        // Arrange
        string currentVersion = "2.0.0";
        var mockUpdateChecker = new Mock<IUpdateChecker>();
        mockUpdateChecker
            .Setup(x => x.CheckForUpdates("myusername", "myrepository", currentVersion))
            .Returns(false);

        // Act
        bool updateAvailable = mockUpdateChecker.Object.CheckForUpdates("myusername", "myrepository", currentVersion);

        // Assert
        Assert.False(updateAvailable);
    }
}
```
>
> ðŸ¤– In this example, the `IUpdateChecker` is an interface that defines the CheckForUpdates method which the `UpdateChecker` class implements.
>
> ðŸ¤– In the test cases, we are creating a mock object of `IUpdateChecker` using the `Mock` class from Moq, and configuring it to return the expected value when the `CheckForUpdates` method is called using the `Setup` method.
>
> ðŸ¤– The `Object` property of the mock object is used to access the mock implementation of the `CheckForUpdates` method.
>
> ðŸ¤– In this way, the test cases can run without making a real API call, and the test cases will assert the expected outcome.
>
> ðŸ¤– Again, this is just an example, you will need to adapt the test cases and the mock implementation to your specific needs.

            // Compare the current version to the latest version
            return currentVersion != latestVersion;
        }
    }
}

class Package
{
    public string version { get; set; }
}
```
>
> ðŸ¤– This code is making an API call to the GitHub Package Registry API to get the packages available for the specified repository, and deserialize the response in a list of packages. Then it finds the latest version of the package using the `Max` method of the list and compares it to the `currentVersion` passed as parameter. If they are different it means that a new version is available and it returns true.
>
> ðŸ¤– It's important to note that this code assumes that you have the right authentication set up, and that your repository is public. If your repository is private, you will need to include a token with the API call to authorize the request. Also, it's worth noting that GitHub Package Registry API is currently in beta, so the URL, the expected structure and the authentication might change.
>
> ðŸ¤– It is also important to add exception handling and also to check the response status code, to make sure that the API call was successful before trying to deserialize the response.
>
> ðŸ¤– This is just an example, you will need to adapt the code to your specific needs and to handle any error that may occur.

â€‹>
> ðŸ¤– The `Package` data type is a custom class that is used to deserialize the JSON response from the GitHub Package Registry API.
>
> ðŸ¤– In the example I provided, the `Package` class has a single property called `version`, which represents the version of the package in the GitHub Package Registry. When the `CheckForUpdates` method makes an API call to the GitHub Package Registry API, it receives a JSON response containing information about the packages available in the repository. This JSON response is deserialized into a list of `Package` objects, and the `version` property is used to find the latest version of the package.
>
> ðŸ¤– The `Package` class is defined as follow:

```csharp
class Package
{
    public string version { get; set; }
}
```

>
> ðŸ¤– This class could have other properties as well, depending on the information that the API returns.
>
> ðŸ¤– It's important to note that the structure of the response of the API call may change depending on the version of the API or the package you are using. You should check the API documentation to see the expected structure of the response.
