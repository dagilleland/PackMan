> ðŸ˜ƒ How would I use 3rd party REST APIs in C# with the `System.Net.Http` and `System.Text.Json` libraries?
â€‹>
> ðŸ¤– You can use the `System.Net.Http` library to make HTTP requests to a REST API and the `System.Text.Json` library to parse the JSON response. Here is an example of how you can use these libraries to make a GET request to a REST API and parse the JSON response:

```csharp
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text.Json;

// Create a new HttpClient instance
using (var client = new HttpClient())
{
    // Send a GET request to the API
    var response = await client.GetAsync("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
    
    // Check if the request was successful
    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        // Read the response content as a string
        var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        
        // Deserialize the JSON to a dynamic object
        var data = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<dynamic>(json);
        
        // Access the properties of the object
        var id = data.id;
        var title = data.title;
    }
}
```

> ðŸ¤– You can also use `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>` to deserialize the json to a strongly typed object, where T is the type of your object.
â€‹>
> ðŸ¤– Please note that this is just an example, and you will need to replace the URL and the object type based on your API endpoint and the expected response structure.
>
> ðŸ˜ƒ Do you know which GitHub API calls do not require authentication?
â€‹>
> ðŸ¤– Yes, some of the GitHub API calls do not require authentication. These include:
â€‹>
> - Retrieving public information about a user: `GET /users/{username}`
> - Retrieving public information about a repository: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}`
> - Retrieving a list of public repositories for a user: `GET /users/{username}/repos`
> - Retrieving a list of all public repositories: `GET /repositories`
> - Searching for repositories: `GET /search/repositories`
â€‹>
> ðŸ¤– However, please keep in mind that unauthenticated requests are limited by the API's rate limit, which is much lower than for authenticated requests. Also, some information about a repository or user that is private may not be accessible without authentication.
â€‹>
> ðŸ¤– Additionally, if you want to perform any write operation such as creating a new repository, editing a repository, creating a new issue, etc. you must have an authenticated session, using your GitHub personal access token.
>
> ðŸ˜ƒ In the sample code for calling a REST API, what code should I use to set appropriate headers (such as for authentication)?
>
> ðŸ¤– You can use the HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders property to set headers for all requests made with that HttpClient instance. Here's an example of how you can set the Authorization header for an authenticated request:

```csharp
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text.Json;

// Create a new HttpClient instance
using (var client = new HttpClient())
{
    // Set the Authorization header
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN");
    
    // Send a GET request to the API
    var response = await client.GetAsync("https://api.github.com/user");
    
    // Check if the request was successful
    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        // Read the response content as a string
        var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        
        // Deserialize the JSON to a dynamic object
        var data = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<dynamic>(json);
        
        // Access the properties of the object
        var login = data.login;
        var name = data.name;
    }
}
```

>
> ðŸ¤– Here, I've set the Authorization header to a value of "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN". Bearer token is commonly used by OAuth2 based authentication, where YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN is the token obtained from the OAuth2 server.
>
> ðŸ¤– You can also add any other headers that may be required by the API you are calling. For example, if the API requires a user-agent header:

```csharp
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent", "MyApp/1.0");
```

>
> ðŸ¤– Note that some APIs may require special headers for each request, for example a nonce or timestamp, in that case you need to set the headers for each request and not as a default header.
>
> ðŸ˜ƒ Remind me, what is a "nonce" again?
>
> ðŸ¤– A nonce is a number that is used only once. In the context of authentication and cryptography, it's a random value that is generated and used only once in a cryptographic communication. A nonce value is typically used to prevent replay attacks, which is a type of network attack where an attacker intercepts and resends a valid communication in order to gain unauthorized access. The nonce value makes the communication unique and prevents the attacker from reusing the same communication.
>
> ðŸ¤– In some APIs, nonce value is used as a security measure to prevent replay attacks. The nonce value is sent along with the request and the server then validates that the nonce value is unique, if it is not it will reject the request.
>
> ðŸ¤– It is important to note that nonce value should be unique for each request and it should be generated randomly, otherwise it will not serve its purpose and will be easy for an attacker to predict and reuse the value.
>
> ðŸ˜ƒ Can GUIDs be used for nonce values?
>
> ðŸ¤– Yes, GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) can be used as nonce values. A GUID is a 128-bit value that is guaranteed to be unique across all devices and all time, which makes it suitable for use as a nonce value.
>
> ðŸ¤– A common way to generate a new GUID is by using the Guid.NewGuid() method in C#.

```csharp
Guid nonce = Guid.NewGuid();
```

>
> ðŸ¤– It is important to note that, as with any nonce value, the GUID should be generated and used only once, and it should be stored securely.
>
> ðŸ¤– A GUID is used as a unique identifier, which makes it suitable for use as a nonce value because it guarantees that the value will be unique across all devices and all time. However, a nonce value can be of any type, it does not have to be a GUID specifically, it can be any unique identifier that is hard to predict, like a random number, or a combination of a timestamp and a random number.
